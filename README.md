## CURRENCY CONVERTER GUI

This project introduces a currency converter application built in Python with PySide2. The "currency_converter" provides a straightforward GUI for converting currency values. Key features include:

* #### Currency Selection:

    Users can choose source and target currencies from dropdown menus.

* #### Amount Input:

    The application allows users to input monetary values for conversion.

* #### Currency Swap:

    A dedicated button, "Inverser devises," swaps the selected currencies for added convenience.

* #### Real-Time Conversion:

    The application dynamically computes converted values based on user inputs.
